# Lotus-style React + Tailwind (starter)

This is a starter scaffold to build a Lotus Caravans-like website using **React 19** + **Tailwind CSS**.
It includes a small `Motion` component that uses the Web Animations API to mimic a framer-motion-like API
(so you don't need framer-motion).

## Quick start

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run dev`
3. Open `http://localhost:5173`

## Features included
- Responsive layout with Tailwind CSS
- `Motion` component (`src/lib/Motion.jsx`) that accepts `initial`, `animate`, and `transition` props
- `useScrollReveal` hook to reveal sections on scroll
- `useParallax` hook for hero parallax effect
- Example components: Navbar, Hero, RangeGrid, Gallery, Footer, ContactForm
